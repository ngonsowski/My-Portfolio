      <h2>Research </h2>
      <h3>Interview Plan </h3>
      <p>The team wanted to understand what would motivate bored millennials to try and 
        engage in new hobbies. To identify the pain points of our users, we needed to 
        research what prevents people from staying engaged in new hobbies. We interviewed 
        6 users ranging from ages 25 to 35 and asked them questions related to these pain points.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Being bored at home during quarentine.</li>
          <li>Having a hard time learning about new hobbies</li>
          <li>Has trouble find hobbies that fit thier personality</li>
          <li>Hates trying things alone</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Affinty Diagram </h3>
        <p>We took the information we gathered from the interviews and sorted
           it into different catgories based on the responses. We found that most people
            interviewed noted that would be more encouraged to stay engaged with a hobby 
            if they participated with a group, and that many people were concerned about 
            having the proper supplies or equitment for a new hobby.</p>

        <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype </h3>
        <p>We created a low-fidelity prototype in Figma to test our initial design ideas and layouts.</p>
        <img src="images/wb-lowfi.png">
        

        <h3 class="features">Core Features</h3>

        <h5>Whims</h5>
        <p>Still need a bit of motivation, follow your hobbies whim page to find a community of people posting about it. </p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>We created a testing plan to determine if users could easily navigate our app.</p>

                <li>Set up an account</li>
                <li>Post an image to their social feed with a whim</li>
                <li>Follow someone and message them</li>
                <li>Purchase a hobby kit from the store</li>

                <li>Multiple users struggled to find where messaging was located.</li>
                <li>One user commented that they wished they could search for people by username.</li>

        <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype </h3>
        <p>I wanted Whimsy Boxes’ look playful and bright, while still feeling sleek and modern.  
          I chose orange as the primary color, though and used sans-serif font throughout the app. 
          To not overwhelm the user mostly I stuck to using orange in menus and buttons, and leaving 
          the rest of the sopace white.  </p>

      <div id="takaways">
        <h2>Key Takaways</h2>
        <p>I have learned how important it is to set up guid;ines from the start, especially in a group setting. 
          This way people are in agreement about what fonts to be using, what the photos should look like, etc. 
          That way we don’t have to go bakc and make things match later.</p>

        <p>Going forward, my hope is to futher integrate whims into the app, particullary within the posting process. 
          I would also like to add some type of event planner or calender to make group activities easier to plan. </p>
